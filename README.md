# Introduction
![v1 0 playthrough - frame at 0m4s](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e8963b9-394f-4c59-8953-58d94f764397)

The fundamental objective of a platformer is to avoid death. But what if we flip that idea upside down? Imagine a platformer where your goal isn't to survive, but to crash into a spike. If that sounds like your kind of thing, then Die to Win is the game for you.

# Features
Play through 16 levels, each with its own gimmick. From password guessing to playing Tic-Tac-Toe against bot, the levels will always keep you engaged.

Experience unique gameplay features such as Dash Orb - an orb that lets you dash through the level, Spider Pad - a pad that teleports you around, and many more.
